# Phone_Book_App_Binary-search-tree-BTS-
data structure school project
Project Description: In this project, you will create a phonebook application that stores contact 
information using a BST data structure. The application will allow users to add, search, and delete contacts 
from the phonebook. You will need to implement advanced search functionality that allows users to 
search for contacts based on name in logarithmic time. Additionally, you need to be able to schedule 
events and appointments with contacts.
